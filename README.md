### Most significant projects: 

1. **Identification and classification of sea going vessels using SAR satellite images**: https://github.com/DariuszKobiela/identification-and-classification-of-sea-going-vessels-using-satellite-images. 
   <p>This project was part of my Master Thesis and was presented on IGARSS 2023 conference in Los Angeles, USA (https://2023.ieeeigarss.org/) in the form of the poster and scientific article and later published in IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing journal. The main goal of the project was the implementation and analysis the possibility of using machine learning and computer vision to identify (indicate the location of) all sea-going vessels located in a selected area of the open sea and to classify the shipsâ€™ types. The most important steps consisted of overview of available ship position data, selecting the area and analysis time, automatic tagging of data, development of detection and classification algorithm and analysis of results. </p>

2. **Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering (NGCF)**: https://github.com/DariuszKobiela/ngcf-neural-graph-collaborative-filtering
   <p>Computations for this project were carried out using the computers of Centre of Informatics Tricity Academic Supercomputer & Network (https://task.gda.pl). Obtained results were presented during ADBIS 2023 conference (https://www.essi.upc.edu/dtim/ADBIS2023/) and later published by Springer journal (https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-42941-5_54). The goal of the study was to verify the robustness of the NGCF (Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering) technique by assessing its ability to generalize across different datasets. The most common example of using this algorithm are recommendation systems. </p>

3. **Vehicle type recognition based on audio data**: https://github.com/DariuszKobiela/vehicle-type-recognition-based-on-audio-data
   <p>The goal of the project was to create a neural network model, which basing on the input data in the form of an audio files would be able to recognize the type of the vehicle passing. Main steps og the project included signal processing (processing audio files) into spectrograms and MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients), then classification using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and autoencoders. </p>
   
3. **ARIMA vs LSTM of NASDAQ stock exchange data**: https://github.com/DariuszKobiela/arima-vs-lstm-on-nasdaq-stock-exchange-data. 
   <p>This project was part of my Bachelor Thesis and was presented on KES 2022 conference in Verona, Italy (http://kes2022.kesinternational.org/) in the form of oral presentation and scientific paper published by Elsevier journal (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2022.09.445). Thesis was written in cooperation between GdaÅ„sk University of Technology and NASDAQ (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations) stock exchange (https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/nasdaq-data-on-demand) and Warsaw Stock Exchange, using data provided by them. Performed study compares the results of two completely different models: statistical one (ARIMA) and deep learning one (LSTM) based on a chosen set of NASDAQ data. Both models are used to predict daily or monthly average prices of chosen companies listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. The most important steps of the project were time series processing and normalization for further processing in statistical models and recurrent neural networks (LSTM, GRU). </p>
